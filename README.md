# CS341: Re-inventing the internet

# Directories
As of now, we will have a code directory, a research directory, and one exclusively for reports. Clear and relevant document titling is crucial. As the project progresses, we may see the need for others but right now that is all we are aware of. 

# Git practices
Our repository's main branch will be exclusively working and throughly tested code. When someone in the group is tweaking and experimenting, they should create a seperate branch that is titled appropriately. Once again, this branch should NOT be merged unless it is fully functional and necessary for group progress. Within all branches, only relatively large chunks of code modifcations or additions necessitate a commit; one does not need to commit every little adjustment. 

# Communications and commitments
As of now, our informal primary form of communication will be text message. We will use this to update eachother on progress when not together as well as coordinate meeting times. If a group member does not respond within 2 hours and there is not a previously klnown obligation that they are at, we will call them.
