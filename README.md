# CS341: Re-inventing the internet
This project is the building up of a network model from scratch in 3.5 weeks. The final working network demo exists within the demo folder. Given the time, constraint, we have not yet finished integrating an additional application (battleship) on top of our existing application (chat feature), so the application demo code does not run. You must run this on Raspberry Pi's with the pigpiod_if2 library downloaded onto them. Every machine/pi must have a unique 'name' (to represent its address) for succesful routing. In our model's current state, this name must be manually assigned in the 'threaded_network' file in the 'this_machine' struct. More on this can be read in our final paper. The progress folder shows our daily typeset progress reports, which was required for our class, and shows the project flow.
