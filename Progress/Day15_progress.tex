%% Section enumerating progress from the previous day. Items people were responsible for in the last progress report must appear. Additional tasks that the group agreed to add since the last progress report may be presented here.
\section*{Previous Goals and Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
\item ASCII encoding and decoding (DONE) - Oliver
\item Isolated the link layer into a header file ran by our new network layer (DONE) - Oliver 
\item Implemented the network layer with a hard coded 'map' (done but needs much more testing) - Evelyn
\item Eradicated all memory leaks and other instances of poor memory usage where we had been getting lucky (DONE) - both 
\item Error Detection system prompting the user to retype (DONE) - Oliver
\end{itemize}
%% Sections above should be short bullets. Longer free form discussion of information from above goes here. These should still be short! More that a couple sentences and the discussion is better suited as a results write-up, appendix, or design document.
\section*{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
\item Struggled heavily this week with debugging the network layer in the program. Errors would appear once and then change, we experienced long pauses without errors before the program would break entirely.
\item we eradicated all memory leaks but were still stumped with explainable errors within the network/link layer which messed with the sending timing sequences in our Manchester encoding inexplicably.
\item we are still pushing on towards an application layer in the form of the game battleship between two pi's, the turn based game play lends itself well to the program. 
\item all of the components of our program theoretically should be running fluidly but we are still running into new errors whenever the program is run.

\end{itemize}
