%% Section enumerating upcoming tasks and task owners for roughly the next 24 hours
\section*{Next Goals and Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
\item Continue NRZ research - Evelyn/Oliver
\item Tests for NRZ experiment 1 written in C - Evelyn/Oliver
\item Find a third group member
\item Pulse experiment (light turns on) - Evelyn/Oliver
\item Continue error detection research - Eveyn/Oliver
\item Error detection/correction test - Deferred
\end{itemize}
%% Section enumerating progress from the previous day. Items people were responsible for in the last progress report must appear. Additional tasks that the group agreed to add since the last progress report may be presented here.
\section*{Previous Goals and Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
\item Setup private github repo (DONE) - Evelyn
\item Commit README.md with practices (DONE) - Day 1 team meeting, commit by Evelyn
\item HW Pin Mapping (DONE) - all, commit by Oliver (NIC AND GPIO pinmapping - Sheet1.pdf)
\item Research NRZ encoding (partial...) - bibtex additions by all (bib.tex)
\item Research error detection (not started) - agreed to defer until we have some experience with the HW
\end{itemize}
%% Sections above should be short bullets. Longer free form discussion of information from above goes here. These should still be short! More that a couple sentences and the discussion is better suited as a results write-up, appendix, or design document.
\section*{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
\item Team talked through the weekly milestones and how we can approach those day by day to ensure that we are on track 
\item We began research into error detection but it was not resonating well with us as we are not yet comfortable with sending and receiving bits. We will resume this research after our experiment is hopefully successful, as the NICS are known to be noisy/slightly faulty. 
\item Continue NRZ research - We don't quite yet understand the flaws of NRZ, specifically how the transmitter clock can become unsynchronized. This seems like something we want to really understand so that we can prevent it 
\item NRZ Experiment 1 - Produce and commit C code that tries to send/recv 1 bit using a single node. If this is successful, we will expand to sending and receiving 4 bit patterns. We will try to get to running the experiment today. This will help us begin our error detection research. 
\end{itemize}
