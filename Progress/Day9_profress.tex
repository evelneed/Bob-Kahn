%% Section enumerating upcoming tasks and task owners for roughly the next 24 hours
\section*{Next Goals and Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
\item ASCII encoding and decoding (pushed back)
\item Research and start working on addressing - Oliver
\item Experiments to triple check error detection - Evelyn
\item Continue network layer and path finding research - Evelyn/Oliver
\item isolate the linked layer to be implemented by the network layer - Oliver
\item creating simple network layer with a hard coded routing table - Evelyn and Oliver
\end{itemize}
%% Section enumerating progress from the previous day. Items people were responsible for in the last progress report must appear. Additional tasks that the group agreed to add since the last progress report may be presented here.
\section*{Previous Goals and Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
\item Successfully got two machines talking back and forth! (DONE) - Both, commit by Oliver
\item Redid wave layer and removed it again (DONE) - Evelyn
\item ASCII values to bits (DONE) - Oliver
\item Error encoding and detection with parity bit (DONE) - Evelyn
\item Abandoned global variables (DONE) - Oliver
\end{itemize}
%% Sections above should be short bullets. Longer free form discussion of information from above goes here. These should still be short! More that a couple sentences and the discussion is better suited as a results write-up, appendix, or design document.
\section*{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
\item Continually working on different error detection implementations, encountering a lot of errors.
\item We are not still not prioritizing text to bit conversion as we think our time is better spent moving past the link layer
\item Heavily researched the network layer today and understand the path forward with beginning with packing the addressing and message as well as a hard coded routing table before moving on towards a more dynamic system.
\item Currently switching the linked layer to be more externally accesible by the network layer as its intended purpose as well as the packing of the entire message to be transfered to another system. 
\end{itemize}
