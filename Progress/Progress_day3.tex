%% Section enumerating upcoming tasks and task owners for roughly the next 24 hours
\section*{Next Goals and Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
\item Continue NRZ research - Evelyn/Oliver
\item Continue error detection research - Evelyn
\item Create and run an experiment on error detection + correction
\item Pulse Experiment (Evelyn)
\item Callback Experiment (Oliver)
\item chars to bits experiment (Oliver)
\item Work with user input for bit sequences to send and receive for demo (Oliver and Evelyn)
\end{itemize}
%% Section enumerating progress from the previous day. Items people were responsible for in the last progress report must appear. Additional tasks that the group agreed to add since the last progress report may be presented here.
\section*{Previous Goals and Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
\item Pulse experiment (DONE) - Evelyn and Oliver, commit by Oliver (Experiments/pulsetest.c)
\item Pulse experiment timing + write up (DONE) - All, write up by Oliver (Experiments/pulsewriteup.txt)
\item Continued research NRZ encoding (partial...) - bibtex additions by all (bib.tex)
\item 4 bit sending and receiving using cable (DONE) - Evelyn and Oliver, commit by Oliver (Experiments/NRZexp.c)
\end{itemize}
%% Sections above should be short bullets. Longer free form discussion of information from above goes here. These should still be short! More that a couple sentences and the discussion is better suited as a results write-up, appendix, or design document.
\section*{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
\item Struggled heavily with the initial communication between two machines, but it deepened our understanding of the problem that needs to be solved.
\item Working with initial pulse and callback experiments provided initial success with getting two machines to recognize communication without just pressing run at the same time. 
\item We will continue to work with the basics of getting the machines to communicate and our path towards that goal. The previous classes final papers provided a helpful roadmap and initial steps to take towards success.
\item Demo 1 (monday) - currently I feel that we are on track to accomplish the goal of back and forth communication between machines for the Monday demo. 
\end{itemize}
