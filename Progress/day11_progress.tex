%% Section enumerating upcoming tasks and task owners for roughly the next 24 hours
\section*{Next Goals and Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
\item Error detection / correction (pushed back) - Evelyn
\item Test network layer further - both
\item Upgrade network layer past a hard coded "map" - both
\item Create sophisticated path-finding algorithm - both
\item Upgrade addressing strategy to be more realistic and robust for more machines - both
\item Begin the final paper -both
\item Implement sending and recieving more than just back and forth communication - both 
\end{itemize}
%% Section enumerating progress from the previous day. Items people were responsible for in the last progress report must appear. Additional tasks that the group agreed to add since the last progress report may be presented here.
\section*{Previous Goals and Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
\item ASCII encoding and decoding (DONE) - Oliver
\item Isolated the link layer into a header file ran by our new network layer (DONE) - Oliver 
\item Implemented the network layer with a hard coded 'map' (done but needs much more testing) - Evelyn
\item Eradicated all memory leaks and other instances of poor memory usage where we had been getting lucky (DONE) - both 
\end{itemize}
%% Sections above should be short bullets. Longer free form discussion of information from above goes here. These should still be short! More that a couple sentences and the discussion is better suited as a results write-up, appendix, or design document.
\section*{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
\item Today we successfully implemented the network layer with a hard coded map to get consistent communication between two pis with a third in the middle. 
\item currently trying to implement back and forth communication instead of one pi sending and receiving one at a time.
\item eradicated all memory leaks in the program. 
\item moving forward if time allows we will return to error correction in the linked layer just by prompting the user to send the message again. Currently we sometimes get random timing errors sporadically that are typically fixed by the next send.
\item Hopefully in the future additionally upgrading then network layer to dynamically add new pis into the program.
\item progress is moving steadily, just hoping to get all of the demos done by the classes conclusion. 
\end{itemize}
